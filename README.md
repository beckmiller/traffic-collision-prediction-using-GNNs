## Abstract:
Traffic collisions in Los Angeles pose significant societal challenges due to urbanization and congestion. We propose a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) that models the cityâ€™s road network as a dynamic graph with temporal features. Our goal is to identify high-risk areas and predict future collision hotspots using advanced data mining techniques. The project aims to provide actionable insights for urban planners to enhance public safety and reduce collision rates.
